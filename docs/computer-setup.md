In this class you will use tools and workflows that web developers use in the industry. Also, it is a lot more efficient
than using the typical LMS. It will seem foreign when you start but be a little patient & persistant.


## 1. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

If you have used programs like MS-Word, you have used an IDE. IDEs are specialized programs that provide features and tools that make your development process efficient. Just like you would use MS-Word to write and format papers, resumes, or letters we will use something similar in this class to write HTML, CSS and some Javascript.  

### VS Code

You can download the **free** version from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">https://code.visualstudio.com/download</a>. Choose the correct installer based on your computer OS.

 Once the download is complete, launch the installer and follow the steps.

## 2. Git & GitHub

These are 2 different tools - don't let the names confuse you. Below is a brief explanation of what they are 

### git

git is a program that you install on **your computer** which can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. It is a distributed version control system primarily used in software development. You might have used the 'Track Changes' feature in MS-Word - git does all that and a lot lot more.


### GitHub

GitHub is a web-based git server. It complements git in ways that makes it possible for a team of developers to contribute to a single project. It also provides a way to store your code remotely. 

Follow these steps to configure your computer

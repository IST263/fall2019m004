### Project Idea ###

Submit a half page proposal (50 - 100 words) describing the main idea behind your project. You should also include some information about what you intend to have in the different pages. 

### Project Media + Sitemap ###

In your `project` folder create a separate sub-folder to collect the media you intend to include in your website. Media can be images, links to videos, audio files and content. You can paste the links in a MS-Word document or a regular text file. Some of the content that you find on the internet can be copyrighted so make sure you also save the source information.  

Submit a [Sitemap](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Site-Map-in-Microsoft-Word) for your project. Even though you only need 3 unique pages you can list more sub-pages as needed.

### Wireframes ###

These are the project blue prints. You will use these as guides to implement the web pages. There are vast number of tools you can use to create wireframes. We will talk more about wireframes during class starting around Week 4.

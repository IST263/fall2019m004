## Assessment, Points & Grade Rubric
Because there are several course objectives I will assess your performance on several measures.


&nbsp; | BB Code | Total Points
 -------------  | | 
Midterm Exam | MTE | 12
Pre-Class Summary | PCM | 8 (0.25 for each class)
Weekly Assignments | W* | 20 
Class Contribution | CC | 10
[Individual Project](/projects/individual/) | INDVPRJ | 50
SAGE | SG | 0
| | 100


### Midterm Exam
This will be a closed book exam. This is used to evaluate your recall and understanding
of course material, as well as your ability to apply it to new situations.


### Weekly Assignments
Most weeks you will have some form of assignment. It could be summarizing some
reading material, and/or writing HTML/CSS/Javascript.  
- Each assignment will be weighted differently.  
- All weekly assignments are due by Saturday 11:59PM of the week they are assigned.  
- Assignments should be submitted via Git. Anything emailed or sent via Blackboard will receive a zero.  


### Class Contribution
These 10 points are there to motivate you to do more than just come to class. Asking questions, responding to other people's questions, insightful thoughts, etc all add up to class contibution. 


### Individual Project
This project will be due around week 13 and will be a culmination of everything learnt
from week 1 - 13. You will be required to work parts of it each week starting week 2.


### SAGE - Self Assessment
SAGE is a required online self-assessment. Each week you’ll answer questions focused
on course-related behaviors that I believe are essential for success. Once you’ve done
so you’ll be able to see the pattern of your responses in the context of the patterns of
others in the class My hope is that this will help you by continuously reminding you of
the actions that make for success.  
NOTE: NONE of the information submitted in these reports will be used in the
determination of your grade - so be honest with yourself and me.

## University-Mandated Course Policies

### Academic-Integrity Policy

School of Information Studies (iSchool) Syracuse University Syracuse University’s academic integrity policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy in effect at
the School of Information Studies defines our expectations for academic honesty and
holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should
understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as
well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The pilot policy governs
appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and
assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification
of participation in class activities. The pilot policy also prohibits students from submitting
the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance
from both instructors. Under the pilot policy, students found in violation are subject to
grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions
determined by the School or College where the course is offered. SU students are
required to read an online summary of the university’s academic integrity expectations
and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during preterm
check-in on MySlice. For more information, see [http://academicintegrity.syr.edu](academicintegrity.syr.edu).

### Disability-Related Accommodations
Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of
mutual respect and full participation. If you believe that you need accommodations for a
disability, please contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS),
disabilityservices.syr.edu, located at 804 University Avenue, room 309, or call
315.443.4498 for an appointment to discuss your needs and the process for requesting
accommodations. ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related
accommodations and will issue “Accommodation Authorization Letters” to students as
appropriate. Since accommodations may require early planning and generally are not
provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible. Our goal at the iSchool
is to create learning environments that are useable, equitable, inclusive and welcoming.
If there are aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to
your inclusion or accurate assessment or achievement, please meet with me to discuss
additional strategies beyond official accommodations that may be helpful to your
success.

### Religious Observances Policy:
SU’s religious observances policy, found at supolicies.syr.edu/emp_ben/
religious_observance.htm , recognizes the diversity of faiths represented in the campus School of Information Studies (iSchool) Syracuse University
community and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holy
days according to their tradition. Under the policy, students should have an opportunity
to make up any examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to a
religious observance provided they notify their instructors no later than the end of the
second week of classes through an online notification form in MySlice listed under
Student Services/Enrollment/My Religious Observances/Add a Notification.

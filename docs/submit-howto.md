Couple of things to keep in mind

* You can submit aka commit your work as often as you want. 
* I encourage you to commit your work everytime you work on it even if you only partially finished it. 
* Only the last commit before the due date will be evaluated
* Committing code onto GitHub will ensure that there is a backup of your work
* Git will ONLY track your work that is done in the course folder you have setup

## Submitting/Committing your homework 


I assume you have done and saved your work in the class folder. Follow these steps everytime you want to commit your work.


1. Launch the GitHub desktop client. 
2. On a Windows PC it should look something like the pic below.

    * Make sure the correct repo is selected (topmost arrow)
    * 'Changes' will list all the files that have been changed since the last commit.       
    
3. Enter a meaningful commit message - this is to help you remember what you have completed so far. Only you and the instructor will be able see this.

4. Click 'Commit to Master'. You will also notice that in the 'Changes' box it will read '0 changed files'. 

5. Now we can upload the files to GitHub. Click 'Push Origin'.

6. Congratuations you just committed your work to GitHub.


## Pulling homework feedback & points
    The instructor has cloned every student's course folder on his workstation as well. That allows him to view and evaluate your committed work. After the homework is evaluated he will add notes/comments to your file(s) and assign the homework points. 

Follow these steps to pull the homework points & feedback

1. Launch the GitHub desktop client. 

2. On a Windows PC it should look something like the pic below.

4. Click on 'History' tab to see that changes posted by the Instructor have been downloaded.
